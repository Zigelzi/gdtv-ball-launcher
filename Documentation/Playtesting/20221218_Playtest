# Playtesting @ 18.12.2022
Testing bounce mechanic and first 4 levels with MG.

## Observations
1. Player is not able to complete levels, because it's not sure how bouncing works.
2. Player is not able to complete levels, because they're not able to bounce the emotion high enough
   1. Bouncing requires very quick movement, which is hard to do
3. Sometimes emotion bounces while flying, why?
4. Second level is slower than other levels, because it requires more precise manouvering to cross the chasm
5. Player wants to start the game by having the device in landscape left orientation
