# Todo
List of issues that can be worked to deliver the desired player experience categorised by the design pillars. These can be things that were observed during the playtesting or other feedback and observations.

## Gameplay
1. Fun and useful emotions
   - [x] Player can select doubt as emotion to use
   2. Player can select anxiety as emotion to use
   - [x] Players loses if they run out of emotions
   - [ ] Emotions have their own collision effects
2. Fair and thought provoking levels
   - [x] Level doesn't end before blocks have stopped moving (grace period)
   - [ ] Prototype how to make win condition feel more fair

## UI
- [x] Add main menu UI
- [ ] Add pause UI
- [ ] Display emotion selection UI only on tap


## Levels
1. Smart
   1. Jump over obstacle
   2. Open a path to goal
   3. Wind that needs to be slowed down
   
## Design problems
1. Levels with bouncing obstacles are too easy, because sometimes emotions are able to move too fast
2. Unity remote and device gyro sensors use different axis
   1. Correct axis on device is X axis
